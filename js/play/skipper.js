                if a user has 2 parts to be skipped, for example
                from 10 seconds to 26 seconds, and from 30 seconds
                to 70 seconds, then the first timer should be set to seek
                to 20 seconds 10 seconds after the video started,
                and the second timer should be set to seek to
                70 seconds after 14 seconds. The second timer shouldn't skip
                after 30 seconds, because the video didn't play for
                30 seconds when it reached the 30 second mark of the video.*/
